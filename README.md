3) In those same folders, run "npm start" command as you did on Step 2.

and then Bob's your uncle!

go check out http://localhost:4200 (You'll be able to see frontend on that link)

* if there is an error, go to './frontend' directory and run "npm install" command once again. you might need to download some modules
